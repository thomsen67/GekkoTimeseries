# API corresponding to Gekko 3.1.12
[Gekko](http://www.t-t.dk/gekko/) is a free timeseries-oriented software package for timeseries data management, and for solving and analyzing large-scale timeseries-based models.
An API is a description of classes, fields and methods. All the info shown here is also present in the form of comments in the [source code](https://github.com/thomsen67/GekkoTimeseries), but the API can be easier to navigate for some purposes.
Not all methods have explanations yet, but a lot of the most important have, for instance the methods in Program.cs, G.cs, and O.cs.
